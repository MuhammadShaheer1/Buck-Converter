# Buck-Converter

This project is about Buck Converter as the basic switched-mode power supply topology. 
Buck converter is a DC-DC converter which will step down a higher voltage to a lower 
voltage level, that means output voltage magnitude is less than the input voltage 
magnitude. The Buck Converter produces voltage ranging from the input voltage to down to 
Zero voltage. It is widely used throughout the industry to convert higher DC input voltage 
into lower DC output voltage. A buck converter is a step-down DC to DC converter. For a 
DCâ€“DC converter, input and output voltages are both DC. It uses a power semiconductor 
device as a switch to turn on and off the DC supply to the load. The switching action can be 
implemented by a BJT, a MOSFET, or an IGBT.
